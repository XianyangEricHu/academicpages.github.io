Welcome to my personal webpage! 

Growing up in Suzhou, China, and then going to the US for college, I have embraced a journey enriched by cultural diversity and linguistic exploration. At college, I studied French and Japanese out of my interests--French because I love *Modernism* and Japanese because I love *Jojo's Bizzare Adventure*! During my junior year, I studied away at Paris, France, living with a lovely host family at the beautiful small town, Saint-Mandes. What's best in the comic bookstores being everywhere in Paris. I enjoy classic rock music, particularly the works of *Bob Dylan* and *Lou Reed*. Currently, I am lucky to be studying in the vibrant New York City, where everything is within a grip.

I'm thrilled to have you here and excited to share a slice of my world with you. This space is a vibrant tapestry of my academic journey, professional experiences, and personal interests. Whether you're a fellow professional, a curious learner, or just dropping by, I hope you find something here that inspires you, sparks a conversation, or enriches your day. Feel free to connect with me through this platform â€“ I'm always open to new ideas, collaborations, or just a friendly chat. Thank you for visiting, and enjoy exploring:)
