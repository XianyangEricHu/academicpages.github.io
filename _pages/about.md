Welcome to my personal webpage! 

Growing up in Suzhou, China, and then going to the US for college, I have embraced a journey enriched by cultural diversity and linguistic exploration. 

I'm thrilled to have you here and excited to share a slice of my world with you. This space is a vibrant tapestry of my academic journey, professional experiences, and personal interests. Whether you're a fellow professional, a curious learner, or just dropping by, I hope you find something here that inspires you, sparks a conversation, or enriches your day. Feel free to connect with me through this platform â€“ I'm always open to new ideas, collaborations, or just a friendly chat. Thank you for visiting, and enjoy exploring:)
