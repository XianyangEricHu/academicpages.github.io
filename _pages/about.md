Welcome to my personal webpage!

<br>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I am interested in a broad range of fields, including Data Science, Financial Engineering, and Computational Physics.

Growing up in Suzhou, China, and then going to the US for college, I have embraced a journey enriched by cultural diversity and linguistic exploration. At college, I studied French and Japanese out of my interests—French because I love <em>Modernism</em> and Japanese because I love <em>Jojo's Bizzare Adventure</em>! During my junior year, I studied away in Paris, France, living with a lovely host family at the beautiful small town of Saint-Mandes. What's the best is that there's a comic bookstore on every corner. I enjoy classic rock music, particularly the works of <em>Bob Dylan</em> and <em>Lou Reed</em>. Currently, I am lucky to be studying in the vibrant New York City, where everything is within a grip.
