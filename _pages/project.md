## Dynamic Volatility Arbitrage Strategy Design **[Report](https://erichu12138.github.io/files/Time_Series_Project.pdf)** | **[Code]()**

This is the capstone project for the course Time Series Analysis & Statistical Arbitrage. We implemented a volatility arbitrage strategy by predicting S&P 500 future volatility using GARCH-type models, contrasting it with VIX-implied volatility. Then, we employed dynamic trading rule taking long or short positions guided by a threshold of forecasted errors. The best model achieved a 14.56% annualized return with a 0.4747 Sharpe Ratio in Year 2018-2023 backtesting.

## Research Lab Inventory Management System
**[Report](https://erichu12138.github.io/files/ProjectFinalReport_Junhyuk_Eric.pdf)** | **[Code](https://erichu12138.github.io/files/project.java)** 

Scenario: A student recently took up an on-campus job, managing inventory for a research lab. To streamline the process and improve efficiency, the student proposes a Research Lab Inventory Management System.  
Project Details: We designed an application which includes GUIs to add new products, update product details, manage stock levels, and generate sales reports. Inventory data will be stored in files, simplifying record-keeping. The system significantly reduces manual workload and the likelihood of human error, ensuring more accurate inventory tracking.

## Spotify Music Classification
**[Report](https://erichu12138.github.io/files/ml_capstone_spotify.pdf)** | **[Code](https://github.com/erichu12138/erichu12138.github.io/blob/master/files/ml_capstone_code.ipynb)** 

In this project, I built machine learning models based upon 45,000 songs from Spotify API. After careful preprocessing, train/test split, and normalization, I adopted dimensionality reduction and clustering methods including PCA, T-SNE, and MDS. Then, I used the silhouette score to determine the optimal number of clusters and added the result of k-means as an extra label to boost classification efficiency. Eventually, I classified 5,000 songs into 10 genres via 4 models (SVM/Neural Network/Random Forest/Adaboost) under the convention for supervised learning. Model performances were evaluated using the ROC curve and the highest AUC score achieved was 0.92/1.00.

## SQL Database - New York Stock Exchange
**[Report](https://erichu12138.github.io/files/NYSE.pdf)** | **[Code](https://github.com/erichu12138/erichu12138.github.io/tree/master/files/NYSE)** 

In this project, I created an entity relationship (ER) Diagram for traders, companies, and stock trades. Following the ER diagram, I built six different tables to assemble a simple stock exchange database which is capapble of performing complex queries including secure and structured transactions.
