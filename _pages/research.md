### Transport of Heat/Acoustic Wave in Random Media with Green's Function Formalism

**[DURF Proposal]**(https://erichu12138.github.io/files/DURF_Proposal.pdf)

Currently, I am working in Dr. Stefano Martiniani's Physics [lab](https://martinianilab.org/index.html) on a project focused on using numerical methods to address steady-state transport problems with Green's Function. Although without a formal Physics background, I am using my knowledge in PDE and numerical analysis to develop a numerical solver capable of computing the full response of the medium to external excitations. Now that I have mathematics as my tool, I am confident in taking them to the field of data science for my graduate study. 

### Classical Quantile Regression and 1D Vector Quantile Regression

In OLS, we are often constrained to the following assumptions: linearity; strict exogeneity; no multicollinearity; spherical errors; normality. In the context of quantile regression, the usage of conditional quantile allows one to deal with heteroskedastic data. We may also be able to obtain a more complete picture of the distribution by computing multiple regression curves of different percentiles. Under Prof. Alfred Galichon's guidance, I explored both classical quantile regression and the one-dimensional version of vector quantile regression, originally proposed by Professor Galichon and his colleagues. My work confirmed their equivalence, not just in computational outcomes but also in their linear programming formulation. A significant focus was on the computational aspect, especially the manipulation of matrices to solve quantiles as an optimization problem.
